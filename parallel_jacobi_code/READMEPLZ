Hallo

1.  Shittiest implementation of them all. It's calling the parallel version inside the while + using the atomic for the norm
    Maybe you cannot even run this for large matrices and/or large number of threads because it's just so bad.
    Don't mind if you can't use it at all

2.  We took the parallel declaration out of the while loop. It's better but we still ahve the atomic thing. Also bad as the last one,
    but it should kind of work for your analysis.

3.  In this one we're finally using the reduction clause instead of the atomic. It improves A LOT the performance.
    For smaller values of N and threads it's maybe even better than the 4th one. But when you crank up the numbers HIGHHH (YOLO)
    it should be a little worse.

4.  NUMA NUMA YE NUMA NUMA NUMA YE. That's it, we happy :3

(Don't tell anyone, but for some reason the numbers we are getting in the u matrix are a liiiiitle bit different from the serial implementation)
